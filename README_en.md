# Terminal to python
Hi, this is a Python script that slightly emulates a real Linux terminal. I have nothing more to say.

# Commands:
Supports the following commands:
q/exit: Exit the script.
q/exit -c/--clear: Exit the script and clear the screen.
echo: Prints the text after the command. Example: echo 1 â†’ Output: 1.
cd: Moves you to the specified directory.
cd ~ : Moves you to the home directory.
ls: Shows all files/folders in the current directory.
ls -w: Shows all files in the directory you specify.
ls -m --file/--folder: Creates a file/folder in the current directory.
